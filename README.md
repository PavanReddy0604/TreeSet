# Treeset

# TreeSetLearning

This project provides examples of using TreeSet in Java with different scenarios.

## Description

The project demonstrates the usage of TreeSet and its various methods for storing and retrieving elements in sorted order. It includes examples of using TreeSet with built-in classes, user-defined classes implementing Comparable interface, and user-defined classes with a custom Comparator.

## Usage

The project includes the following classes:

- `Person`: A user-defined class implementing the `Comparable` interface. It represents a person with a name and an ID.
- `Student`: A user-defined class representing a student with a name and an ID.
- `NameComparator`: A custom `Comparator` implementation for sorting `Student` objects based on their names.
- `TreeSetLearning`: The main class that demonstrates the usage of TreeSet and its methods.

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `TreeSetLearning` class.

## Features

The project showcases the following features:

- Creating and adding elements to a TreeSet of built-in classes (`Integer`).
- Using TreeSet methods such as `ceiling`, `descendingSet`, and `descendingIterator`.
- Creating and adding elements to a TreeSet of user-defined class (`Person`) that implements the `Comparable` interface.
- Creating and adding elements to a TreeSet of user-defined class (`Student`) using a custom `Comparator` (`NameComparator`).
